        <h2> Overview </h2>
        <p> The Shenandoah Valley is known for its beauty and adventure. The valley’s rolling hills stretch across the western side of Virginia, through towns like Harrisonburg, Lexington, Staunton and more. </p>
        <p> While the Shenandoah Trail brings tourists to these smaller towns, the COVID-19 pandemic greatly impacted the livelihood of these towns and its citizens, as fewer people were visiting local shops, restaurants and breweries. The Shenandoah Beerwerks Trail Passport Program encourages people to visit local breweries in the Shenandoah Valley and spend time in these towns exploring shops, museums, historical landmarks and the beauty of the Shenandoah.</p>
        <p> The premise of the passport program is simple: drink beer. To participate, all one needs to do is visit any eight of the eighteen participating breweries (found here), drink a craft beer at each location, get your passport stamped, mail it in and you’ll receive a free t-shirt. Each brewery will have different events, such as food trucks and live music, that help other small businesses stay afloat.</p>
        <p> Harrisonburg, Va. is home to five breweries participating in the passport program: Brother’s Craft Brewing, The Friendly Fermenter, Pale Fire Brewing Co., Three Notch’d Valley Collab House and Restless Moons Brewing Company. Each brewery provides a unique environment to relax, unwind and enjoy a refreshing craft beer. Restless Moons has an envious collection of board games and corn hole; Pale Fire has a wall of bookshelves and vinyl records; enjoying a beer at Three Notch’d feels like relaxing in a cozy coffee shop; The Friendly Fermenter is a social underground brewery; and Brother’s Craft is rustic and intimate and has private rooms for larger groups.</p>

            <h2> Pale Fire: Burning Bright</h2>
     
             <p>   This month marks Pale Fire Brewing Co.’s sixth birthday. They celebrated with an outdoor anniversary party, COVID-19 style. 
       Opened on April 10, 2015, the craft brewery and taproom is located in the heart of downtown Harrisonburg. Pale Fire is one of five Shenandoah Beerwerks Trail stops in the Friendly City. 
      “It’s been cool just seeing how it brings people from all over to come check out our brewery. Without the trail, they would’ve never even discovered us.”
     Pre-pandemic, Reynolds was stamping anywhere from five to 50 passports every shift, totaling around 100 per week. 
      “It’s just a cool way to not only support the breweries, but the community as well,” Reynolds said. “It’s gonna, in the long run, really help our businesses and our community be able to expand and grow. In turn, that means we as locals can share our community and what we’re about, and that’s super cool.”</p>
        
    <p>   Pale Fire’s most popular beer, Red Molly Irish Red, won a bronze medal in the Irish-Style Red Ale category in 2016 at the World Beer Cup and in 2019 at the Great American Beer Festival. </p>
             
    <p>    Pale Fire offers between ten and 12 beers at a time, all displayed on vinyl. Artwork is plastered around the tap room and a large bookshelf sits on the back wall. The brewery itself is named after the novel “Pale Fire” by Russian author Vladimir Nabokov. Pre-pandemic, Pale Fire hosted live music shows once or twice a week. </p>
             
    <p> In addition to live music, Pale Fire is known for their Wednesday night trivia. Resuming May 5th after a pause due to COVID-19, there will be roughly 15 to 20 tables that can accommodate groups up to six people. </p>
    
    <p> “It’s cool for people to come in and enjoy beer, but when you can have an activity to do while you’re drinking beer it’s even funner!”

          <h2> Brothers Craft Brewing: It Started as Three Brothers</h2>
    
           <p> Brothers Craft Brewing is a family-owned brewery in Harrisonburg, Virginia. Originally called Three Brothers Brewing, it was founded by the three Shifflett brothers, who grew up in Harrisonburg and always knew they wanted to run a business together. </p>
     
      <p> The taproom and brewing facility operates out of a renovated soda bottling plant, giving the taproom an old, rustic, and vintage charm that pairs well with drinking craft beer. As the brewery has grown, the brothers met so many people — including employees and customers in the  Harrisonburg community — and made strong connections and relationships, they decided to change their name to Brothers Craft Brewing to be more inclusive of everyone they’d met and how their family had grown from way more than just three blood relatives who started the journey.</p>
        
    <p> All breweries like to experiment with different hops and flavors in new beers, but there’s always flagship beers that stay on the menu year round. Josh Wells, taproom manager at Brothers, said flagship beers are a great place to start if you’re visiting for the first time because of the trail and don’t know what to try.</p>
           
    <p> “Any brewery’s basic identity [are] their flagships,” Wells said. “Those are the beers you put your business behind.”
Brothers has four flagships: Hoptimization (an American IPA), The Great Outdoors (A Virginia Pale Ale), The Admiral (a Double IPA) and Lil’ Hellion (a Helles Lager). These beers are available year round in the taproom and are bottled, kegged and distributed to other vendors in Virginia.</p>
           
    <p>The Beerwerks Trail and passport program have helped local breweries like Brothers Craft survive a pandemic by motivating people to get out and try new places in their community, or travel to neighboring communities. The program’s website also promotes local events and things to do in each city on the trail — including music festivals, hiking, cycling, history tours, and more — and places to stay on an overnight trip. Not only is the program supporting the breweries, but it’s supporting other local businesses in these communities as well.
“I think that’s the best part,” Wells said. “Because it’s such a collaboration of businesses all wanting to help people support local business.” </p>

            <h2> Friendly Fermenter: Beer Village</h2>
            <p> When you walk in the doors of the underground nanobrewery you are entering a small community that owner Shawn Gatesman refers to as his village.
        “It’s all what you want,” said Gatesman. That’s the motto of The Friendly Fermenter brewery.</p>
         <p> Gatesman opened the brewery with the goal of creating an atmosphere where people feel comfortable to try what they like. He attributes the success of the brewery to the support he received from friends when he first began homebrewing in 2013. After many experimental batches, he knew he found his niche when friends tried his first “drinkable” beer and said “you made this?”</p>
        
        <p> The Friendly Fermenter finally opened in February 2018. It was the result of the encouragement he received from the community of regulars grew through word of mouth, while he kept on trying new things with his brewing.
        Whether you are a tourist passing through or a local visiting for the first time, every trip to The Friendly Fermenter starts with “ya ever been here before?”</p>
            
        <p> Gatesman brews, on average, two new beers per week. His most popular beers are a honey double IPA called the Bees Knees, a blonde coffee stout called Brehfuss and an Irish multigrain called the Green Jacket. He considers these beers staples at The Friendly Fermenter.</p>
            
        <p> Batches rotate often and he usually makes these beers three or four times per year. The rotation allows Gatesman to experiment with more flavors and gives visitors something new to try each time they visit. Coming back this week is a dragon fruit tart called Enter the Dragon. Gatesman posts upcoming beers on the Friendly Fermenter website that he updates semi-frequently.</p>
            
        <p>The Friendly Fermenter was created to be a place where people could escape from the noise and connect the old-fashioned way. The Friendly Fermenter is his village and the people are his community.
       “Everyone is welcome who is open and non judgemental.”</p>

        <h2> Three Notch'd: Satellite Brewery</h2>  
            <p> “How will you leave your mark?”</p>
            
            <p> This is a question Three Notch’d Brewing Co. asks its customers who flock to the local Valley Collab House just off East Market Street in Harrisonburg. Originally opened in 2013 in Charlottesville, Three Notch’d left its mark in Harrisonburg just one year later in 2014 when it opened its second location just blocks away from City Hall.</p>
            
            <p> To Head Bartender Andrew Shelley, just like how the Charlottesville location reflects its town just 60 miles away, Harrisonburg’s Three Notch’d will do the same. “This brewery needs to not represent Charlottesville,” Shelley said. “The way that was done was [by] hiring people here who represent Harrisonburg.”</p>
            
            <p> With craft beers on tap in several of the town’s local restaurants, Three Notch’d has become a go-to for some of the Valley’s craft beer enthusiasts. Aside from its various beers on tap, Harrisonburg’s Three Notch’d also has one distinction over every other brewery state-wide – it’s the first Virginia brewery to have a satellite location. “What that means is, essentially, you have the main brewery and then they open a secondary location in another spot – this was the first one in Virginia to do that,” Shelley said.</p>
            
            <p> Shelley acknowledges that while the different craft beers sold to the public are a great motivation to get out and travel for oneself, to him, the local businesses and those behind them are what the trail is all about. “I’ve been drinking in town before the beer trail was even a thing,” Shelley said. “I wouldn’t say it’s necessarily the Trail that keeps me going; for me it’s really about the people and supporting this community.”</p>
            
            <p> Special events also keep Three Notch’d going here in Harrisonburg. Some of which in the past have included cycling tournaments on stationary bikes at the brewery, weekly poetry readings during Pride Month and numerous JMU-related events.</p>
            
            <p> For beer, Three Notch’d offers a diverse tap list ready to cater to a wide array of craft beer-lovers both in-house and on-the-go. The brewery currently has six flagship beers on-tap, such as its New England-IPA Minute Man beer and its Jack’s Java Espresso Coffee Stout, as well as nine seasonals. Some of them include the Passion Fruit Gose, which has a smooth and sour, yet fruity, taste, and the Jazzfest Sugarcane Pecan Ale – an American Amber/Red craft brew.</p>
            
            <p> With its casual interior, revolving tap list, and friendly staff, the Three Notch’d Valley Collab House is always ready to open its doors and welcome in thirsty Trail-goers and Harrisonburg residents alike.</p>
            
            <p> “This is almost like a foundational piece to Virginia beer,” said Shelley, smiling and manning the bar. </p>

     <h2> Restless Moons: Backyard Bar</h2>
        
     <p> No two beers are the same at Restless Moons Brewing.</p>
         
     <p> Restless Moons Brewing, , makes beer for brewery lovers who are looking to try something new. From pilsners to IPA’s to sours, Restless Moons, located in Downtown Harrisonburg on Wolfe Street, brews small-batch and changes the recipe every time.</p>
         
     <p>“We’re small enough that people seem to like that we just keep playing around with different things and trying out new things that they haven’t seen before,” said co-owner Jeffrey Moon.</p>
         
     <p> About a year ago the brewery created a pilsner called the Harrisonburger, which became so popular that it is now their flagship.</p>
         
     <p> “It’s pretty easy, clean drinking, beer-flavored beer so people that come in that are looking to get into craft beer but don’t exactly know where to start, that’s always a good suggestion for them,” said Moon. </p>
         
     <p> Pre-COVID you could find comedy shows and live music on the stage in the backyard. As the weather begins to warm up, Restless Moons plans on bringing live music back to their stage on weekends beginning in May. For now, there are new beers on the menu every week.</p>
         
     <p> The atmosphere and brewing style is what Moon envisioned when he bought the brewery in 2017. When Moon came across a listing for a brewery called Wolfe Street Brewing, he was living in Washington D.C. and had an interest in homebrewing. Within a few months, Moon and his wife purchased Wolfe Street Brewing, and Restless Moons Brewing was born. Moon says of the name change, “If we were doing that we were going to put our mark on it as opposed to just continuing what someone else was doing.” The small batch brewing allowed Moon to evolve his style and try new things without having to worry about distribution.</p>
         
     <p> Moon continues to brew creative craft beer and make a name for Restless Moons among the locals. The Shenandoah Beerwerks Trail brings in customers from out of town, and according to Moon, a lot of people from Pennsylvania.</p>
         
     <p> “Randomly, I ran into someone who went to the same high school as me and she knew she knew my sister in high school so that was kind of a weird experience just because we are so far away and what are the chances of that happening?”</p>
